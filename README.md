A Python tool for visualizing pupil reactions to VR/Unity events and exporting experiment data to Excel.  

---

## ðŸ“– Overview  
This project helps a research laboratory process data from medical experiments involving **VR glasses** and **Unity-based events** designed to test pupil reactions.  

The raw experiment output contains:  
- A continuous stream of pupil recordings  
- A timeline of Unity events  

This tool parses the data and outputs:  
- ðŸ“Š **Visualization** â€“ plots pupil reactions alongside Unity events on interactive graphs  
- ðŸ“‘ **Excel Export** â€“ generates an Excel file with relevant metrics
